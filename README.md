It’s a simple program for mobile banking. One can manage their account information, send money to friends and family, withdraw money, pay bills and recharge their mobile by using this program. One must have a mobile banking account on VU Bank to use this program. But we can’t deposit money to our account using this program. To deposit money to our account we have to go to the VU bank or mobile banking agent(sign in program).

#Before using the "Mobile Banking" program, run the "Sign in" program to create an account..
